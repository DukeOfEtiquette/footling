### Description
A React Native app built with the help of Expo. This app takes your name as input and greets you with your geo-location. When you're ready, it will randomly generate a phrase and sweetly play it back to you, along with your name. 

**NOTE**: Turn up the volume of your device!

The Settings Screen is provided by the `expo init` project generator when you choose a `tabs` managed workflow. We kept this screen with zero modification.
